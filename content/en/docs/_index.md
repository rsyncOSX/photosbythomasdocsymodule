#### Birds

Primarily, I capture photographs of birds. Bird photography is approximately 90% waiting and traveling. My knowledge of birds
is still limited, and I am acquiring new information almost daily. The most crucial aspect is to respect the birds and refrain
from chasing them. Familiarize yourself with the habitats of various species and find a suitable spot to observe them from a
distance. Additionally, there are some photographs of wild animals. Some animals were recently discovered; for instance,
I was fortunate enough to be in the right location at the right time, and my camera was prepared.
Muskoxen and moose have been captured during photography excursions in Norway.

#### Nature

Since my childhood, I have had an affinity for to the nature. Photography has been another of my cherished hobbies
for many years. However, I am deeply concerned about the pressing challenges facing nature and wildlife.
Regrettably, many politicians fail to comprehend the paramount importance of preserving these ecosystems.
Through my ongoing research, I have gained a profound understanding of the fragility of nature and the intricate
interconnectedness of all living beings. Alas, humans have proven to be adept at destroying nature through ignorance
and economic incentives, which fills me with profound apprehension.

#### Sony gear

For the last 5 years, I have only used Sony gear. Previous Sony camera bodies are Sony fullframes A7iii and Sony A9ii. I have also used lenses from
Tamron and Sigma, but all are sold. My gear now:

- Sony full-frame A1 camera body
- Sony FE 600mm F4.0 GM OSS lens
- Sony FE 300mm F2.8 GM OSS lens
- Sony FE 1.4x teleconverter

The 600mm and 300mm lenses are superb lens for bird photography. The 1.4TC extends the 600mm to 840mm and the 300mm to 420mm,
two stops down.
