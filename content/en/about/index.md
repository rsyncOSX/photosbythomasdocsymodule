Hello,

My name is Thomas,Â  [thomeven@gmail.com](mailto:thomeven@gmail.com). I retired from work in April 2022 at the age of 62 and I am a passionate photographer of wildlife.
Grandkids, photography, macOS development and being in the Norwegian mountains keep me busy. In mid November 2024 there are about 80 birds and animals, mostly birds
on these website. I am updating when I think there are some photos to publish. I am not communication the site, I am using it myself to learn more about the birds.
There are links to Wikipedia articles for every bird and animal.

**How are these pages constructed?**

Hugo, a static site generator, serves as the web framework responsible for constructing these pages. The source code
for this website is hosted on GitHub. Netlify, the web server, automatically detects changes made to the main branch and
promptly rebuilds the server. The Hugo theme utilized is [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), another open-source
project hosted on GitHub. Upon making modifications or additions to pages, I commit these changes to GitHub, and
Netlify promptly constructs the new server within seconds.
