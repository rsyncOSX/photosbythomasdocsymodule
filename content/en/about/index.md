Hello,

My name is Thomas, and my email address is thomeven@gmail.com. I retired from work in April 2022 at the age of 62 and
am a passionate wildlife photographer. In my retirement, I enjoy spending time with my grandchildren, pursuing photography,
developing macOS application, and exploring the Norwegian mountains. In mid-November 2024, approximately
80 birds and animals, primarily birds, can be found on this website. I update the website when I have taken new
photographs that I believe are worthy of publication. I do not actively manage the site; rather, I use it as a
personal resource to learn more about the birds I photograph. Each bird and animal featured on the website
includes links to Wikipedia articles for further information.

**How are these pages constructed?**

Hugo, a static site generator, serves as the web framework responsible for constructing these pages. The source code for
this website is hosted on GitHub. Netlify, the web server, automatically detects changes made to the main branch and
promptly rebuilds the server. The Hugo theme utilized is [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), another
open-source project hosted on GitHub. Upon making modifications or additions to pages, I commit these changes to GitHub, and
Netlify promptly constructs the new server within seconds.
